This project is a replication of the paper "Ore Image Classification Based on Improved CNN." The authors of the original study addressed the problem of ore classification using well-known CNN architectures, along with transfer learning and data augmentation techniques.
The goal of this project was to implement the described models and their corresponding training pipelines based on the methodology outlined in the original paper. Finally, the obtained results were compared with those reported by the original authors. More information is available in the Report.pdf.
